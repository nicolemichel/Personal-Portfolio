          <h1>I'm Nicole</h1>
          <p>
            I was born in February 1997 (I’m an Aquarius).
            <br />
            <br />

            So, you might not believe in the stars and the “science” of
            astrology but according to the night sky I’m known as an air sign.
            <br />
            <br />
            While I thought this meant I would be light on my feet - air signs
            are really known for being the thinkers, communicators, and doers of
            the world. We are all about ideas, and are always focused on the
            details.

            >
            <br />
            <br />
            But for real, talking about myself is weakness of mine so here’s
            some quick points.

            The story of my coding journey is a bit of a bumpy ride, so be safe
            and strap in.
            <br />
            <br />
            It starts just after high school.
            <br />
            I’m 18 with no idea what I want to do for a career so I decide to
            continue working my retail job at The Source and take some time
            to figure it out.
            <br />
            <br />
            A few years go by and I realise I have a love for technology but
            <strong>definitely</strong> not in an I.T. type of way. Being new to
            the idea I had no clue what other tech jobs were possible so I turned to the internet for an answer.
            <br />
            <br />
            Yup, you read that right. 
            <br/>I took a Google quiz to figure out what I
            wanted to do for a career. Crazy right? But when I read the result
            of “Programmer” and the little blurb that explained what that was, it
            felt like a perfect fit. I mean I like problem solving, I’m
            creative, a good team player, and adaptable.

            That brings us to step two.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm now 21 with a good idea of what I want to do, unsure of what
            school I want to go to and feeling like I’m behind in life with the
            need to make up for lost time.
            <br />
            <br />
            Bring in my sister, Kelsey (31) looking for a career change, also
            feeling the need to make up for lost time - she finds a college an
            hour away that halves the typical time needed for a degree. A
            college that deals only in business, technology and healthcare
            (looking like the universe is doing me a favour and piecing things
            together for me at this point). Anyways, she had a tour lined up and
            I decided to tag along to see what they were about.
            <br />
            <br />
            I ended up sitting in on a class, loving it and signing up to start
            just three short weeks later.

          We’re now at step three.
          <br />
          <br />
          It’s April 16, 2018 I’m starting my first class with absolutely no
          idea what I’m doing, and behind. That’s right, a bump in the road
          right from the start.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since this college lets you start at the beginning of any course new
          students come and go all the time, and because the professor didn’t
          know I would be starting so soon he began the course a week early (he
          made up for it with some one on one time). Skip forward a bit and it’s
          April 27, 2018 just 9 classes later and it’s exam time. The professor
          is standing at the front of the class and telling us that we have 4
          hours to code a page that looks the same as what he has displayed on
          the whiteboard (to give you an idea it was basically a page that looks
          similar to a four square box you find painted on school grounds). He
          also tells us that if we need help we can ask - but marks will be
          deducted anytime he has to come over (this is fair as it’s an exam and
          we should know what we are doing - regardless panic ensues).
          <br />
          <br />
          I was just starting to get the hang of things and hate asking for help
          already, so to know points will be deducted encourages the
          stubbornness.
          <br />
          <br />
          Time seemed to be moving slower and slower in this exam, the class was
          slowly emptying out as students finish and leave, and my stress level
          heightens as I struggle with getting some boxes to sit left and others
          right. Eventually I cave in and ask for help, the professor comes
          over, sits down and explains things and while my exam looked horrible
          it was laid out in the fashion he wished and I completed the class
          with a 79%.
          <br />
          <br />
          I’m grateful for that exam to this day because it challenged me (if
          the course was too easy I probably would have gotten bored, dropped
          out and been back at step one) and I quickly learned that it’s okay to
          ask for help when needed. The rest of the course time felt like it
          flew by, exams and project due dates passed, and next thing you know
          it was time for my internship.

            Which brings us to step four, my internship.
            <br />
            <br />
            This was another tiny bump in the road, because I was travelling to
            London everyday for class I was hoping to find something in Sarnia
            so I didn’t have to travel and could focus on the work I would be
            doing. Luckily the career assistance triOS provides was able to find
            me a placement at
            <strong>tmrrw inc</strong> just in time.
            <br />
            <br />
            From October 2019 to January 2020 I was doing front end work on a
            few different sites - from fixing layout issues to doing page
            animations and at the end of my 400 hours my course was completed
            and I graduated with honours (3.9 GPA/86% average).

            That brings us to step five, post graduation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since my time at triOS was my only coding experience I was majorly
            lacking confidence in my coding abilities and terrified of my
            student debt so here we will take a quick U-Turn because I ran back
            into my comfort zone (sales). I discovered Brookstone Windows and
            Doors on Indeed, applied and started a field marketing job. I won
            awards for highest appointment rate, highest validation rate, rep of
            the quarter (won an XBox Series X), and I was
            also promoted to Team Lead in less than a year.
            <br />
            <br />
            Now bring in the biggest bump, COVID-19. With lockdowns happening on
            and off I decided to refresh my brain, expand my knowledge and boost
            my coding confidence with <strong>SheCodes</strong>.

            I’m still not overly confident in my coding abilities but I'm aware
